Which is Most Reliable? Honda certainly has some impressively reliable cars, but overall, Toyota and its luxury division, Lexus, have traditionally been at or near the top of both J.D. Power‚Äôs and Consumer Reports‚Äô yearly reliability reports. There are seemingly two automakers that will doubtless come up more than the others, though. Honda and Toyota are both widely known for making reliable vehicles, mostly because of their popularity and history of making models capable of driving for well over 200,000 miles. When it comes to overall reliability, though, Toyota sits atop the car kingdom. If you ask a handful of random people on the street who makes the most reliable cars, you will likely hear one of several Japanese automakers like Nissan, Subaru, or Mazda. You may even hear other names like Hyundai, Kia, Chevrolet, Ford, or Volkswagen, depending on who you are talking to and their personal experience with vehicles in the past. Where Honda and Toyota Rank in Reliability Ratings: The most current Consumer Reports data shows that Toyota and Lexus occupy the top two spots as the most reliable car brands currently on the market. Honda is currently in fifth place while their luxury division, Acura, sits in eighth place. J.D Power‚Äôs most recent car brand dependability study also places Lexus high on the list. They sit in first place overall with the fewest problems per 100 vehicles in the first 90 days of ownership. Toyota sits in the seventh-place spot. Honda and Acura both fall below average with Honda occupying the nineteenth spot and Acura taking the twenty-second spot. J.D. Power‚Äôs 2022 data is fairly consistent with their current 2023 list. Toyota and Lexus occupied fifth and sixth place respectively. Honda and Acura have both moved up the list in 2023 with both manufacturers ranking much lower in 2022 than they do in 2023. Neither Honda nor Toyota makes perfect vehicles that never have any issues, but there are several reasons that their vehicles are known for being reliable. Model Comparison: The best way to break down the Honda and Toyota reliability comparison is to examine the models from each manufacturer. Toyota Corolla vs. Honda Civic The Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic are two perennial all-stars in the automotive world. They are two of the most cited models when referencing vehicle reliability, even though they both deliver a completely different driving experience. Both come in sedan and hatchback body styles, but sadly, the sporty Honda Civic Coupe was recently discontinued. If you take both models‚Äô total packages into consideration, the Honda Civic would take the prize. It is more engaging to drive, it is more stylish, and it features a wider variety of powertrain options. When it comes to reliability, though, the Corolla just edges out the Civic. Consumer Reports lists the 2023 Toyota Corolla as a recommended choice by their staff with a perfect 5/5 predicted reliability rating. J.D. Power also gives the Corolla an 85/100 for quality and reliability. The 2023 Civic earns a respectable 4/5 score in predicted reliability and a score of 80 in quality and reliability from J.D. Power. Historical data also favors the Corolla as Consumer Reports consistently rates it much higher than the Civic, whose historical reliability has been more inconsistent. It should also be noted that the Toyota Corolla hatchback is different than the sedan. It earns a lower 3/5 predicted reliability score from Consumer Reports. Toyota Camry vs. Honda Accord Two more giants battle it out with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Much like the Corolla and Civic comparison, most people will put the Accord ahead of the Camry for its styling, more engaging driving experience, and spacious, high-quality interior. There is even a redesigned Honda Accord model coming out in 2023. With that in mind, neither Consumer Reports nor J.D. Power has fully tested and rated the new Honda Accord, but we can look at 2022 data. Again, Toyota takes the win over Honda in the reliability competition. Consumer Reports gives the 2022 Camry a 4/5 rating for reliability while the Accord only earns a 2/5 rating. Historically, the Camry is also more consistently above average in its reliability ratings than the Accord. J.D. Power gives the 2022 Camry a quality and reliability score of 84 while the 2022 Accord earns an 83. Honda HR-V vs. Toyota Corolla Cross The subcompact crossover SUV segment is packed with contenders. Honda‚Äôs HR-V is a compelling choice in the segment due to its size, interior, and recently redesigned look. The Toyota Corolla Cross replaces the discontinued C-HR as their entry into the segment. It too is a practical, attractive option with plenty of safety features and great fuel economy to boot. This competition is the closest one yet. Technically, the Corolla Cross wins because of its perfect 2022 and 2023 reliability scores from Consumer Reports and its 82 rating from J.D. Power. The Honda HR-V earns a perfect reliability score from Consumer Reports in 2022, but the newly redesigned model only earns a 4/5 score. J.D. Power gives the HR-V a score of 75. Despite the HR-V‚Äôs lower overall scores, it has been around longer than the Corolla Cross which made its debut for the 2022 model year. Consumer Reports rates used Honda HR-V models from 2019, 2020, and 2021 with better than average reliability and 2017 and 2018 models with perfect reliability scores. We will call this one a pretty even matchup, resulting in a tie. Honda CR-V vs. Toyota RAV4 Two of the best-selling crossovers in America are pretty evenly matched in a head-to-head battle. With the CR-V‚Äôs recent redesign, it most likely wins the overall prize since the RAV4 has not had a significant redesign since 2019. When it comes to reliability, both vehicles are as evenly matched as they come. The CR-V has a 4/5 predicted reliability rating from Consumer Reports and a score of 83 from J.D. Power. The RAV4 earns the same reliability rating from Consumer Reports but has a slightly lower 82 from J.D. Power. Looking at the historical Consumer Reports data, both models are generally rated higher than average, with a few model years dropping to merely average. Toyota 4Runner vs. Honda Passport From an overall perspective, the Toyota 4Runner is ancient compared to the Honda Passport. Both vehicles occupy the midsize two-row SUV segment, both vehicles have a 5,000-pound towing capacity, and both vehicles come with V6 engines, but the similarities end there. The 4Runner features a body-on-frame design, making it ride more like a pickup truck than a car. Its powertrain is unrefined, it features four-wheel drive rather than all-wheel drive, and it is low on many of the tech features that buyers like in new vehicles. It does, however, have one of the highest resale values on the market and one of the strongest aftermarket support systems. The Passport is a crossover with a smooth powertrain, newly standard all-wheel drive, a spacious interior, plentiful tech features, and a full suite of standard safety features. Although it is marketed as somewhat of an off-road-ready vehicle, the 4Runner is the superior off-road machine. On the reliability front, the 4Runner wins but not by as much of a margin as you might think. The 4Runner is universally known as one of the most reliable vehicles ever made. Its Consumer Reports ratings back that up. A 4/5 predicted reliability score for 2023 is preceded by perfect historical reliability scores for nearly every year in which CR has data. J.D. Power agrees and gives the 4Runner a score of 87 for 2023. The Passport holds its own, though. A J.D. Power score of 83/100, a Consumer Reports predicted reliability score of 4/5 for 2023, and perfect CR reliability scores for both the 2019 and 2022 model years, signify that it is no slouch. Honda Pilot vs. Toyota Highlander In the continuing saga of best-selling crossovers, the newly redesigned Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander enter the ring. The Pilot‚Äôs new look takes it away from the minivan-esque styling it had for years, bringing it more in line with Honda‚Äôs current design philosophy and closer to more traditionally styled SUVs. The Highlander, on the other hand, remains consistent and continues to offer its buyers what they have come to expect from Toyota. Unfortunately, though, Toyota has dropped the previously standard V6 engine, replacing it with a turbo four-cylinder unit in an attempt to increase fuel economy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Toyota Highlander wins the reliability competition here. Those who are fans of the Pilot will perhaps be surprised that this matchup is not as close as you might think. Both vehicles have J.D. Power scores of 81/100. Consumer Reports data tells a different story. The Highlander earns a better-than-average predicted reliability rating for 2023, better-than-average reliability ratings for 2020, 2021, and 2022, and perfect reliability ratings from 2011 to 2019. The Pilot only scores an average predicted reliability rating for 2023, with the worst reliability score that the CR staff can give for 2022.From 2015 to 2021 the Pilot earns average reliability scores at best, with the 2020 model year as the exception with a better-than-average reliability rating from CR. Toyota Tacoma vs. Honda Ridgeline The Toyota Tacoma and Honda Ridgeline pickup truck matchup draws many similarities to the 4Runner and Passport matchup. The Tacoma is a body-on-frame pickup truck, known for having exceptional off-road capability from the factory and a somewhat unrefined, yet not unexpected driving experience for a pickup truck. Conversely, the Honda Ridgeline has a refined ride, a comfortable interior, unibody construction, and a reputation for not being a real pickup truck. Whether or not the Ridgeline is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù pickup truck is a debate for another day. Toyota once again wins the reliability comparison here. The Honda Ridgeline earns consistent average reliability ratings prior to 2023 and an average predicted reliability rating for 2023. The Tacoma is slightly less consistent, but it earns 4/5 reliability and predicted reliability scores from Consumer Reports back to 2019. J.D. Power gives the Tacoma a quality and reliability score of 83 and the Ridgeline a score of 80 for 2023. Toyota Sienna vs. Honda Odyssey With only a handful of minivans on the market, reliability becomes even more important as families will be the primary buying demographic. Both the Sienna and Odyssey have their own benefits. The Odyssey is spacious and packed with safety and tech features while the Sienna comes standard with a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain and optional all-wheel drive. In a slight turn of events, J.D. Power awards the Honda Odyssey with a higher quality and reliability score than the Sienna: An 81 for the Odyssey and a 74 for the Sienna. Consumer Reports flips the script back around, especially when considering historical data. Both minivans earn a 4/5 predicted average reliability for 2023, but the Odyssey is rated higher for 2022. Prior to 2022, the Sienna consistently earns much higher reliability scores than the Odyssey. We will give the nod to Honda here for the newest Odyssey models. Just be aware that used Honda Odyssey models may prove less reliable than new Honda Odyssey models. Honda Civic Si vs. Toyota GR86 Honda is known for making fun-to-drive front-wheel drive cars. Even though many do not consider the Civic Si to be a true sports car, it is an affordable option for those looking for their first entry into the driver‚Äôs car realm. The Toyota GR86, on the other hand, is a pure, rear-wheel drive sports car, designed to provide nimble handling and an uncensored driving experience. Despite their similar purpose, these two vehicles are not that similar. The Civic Si is only available as a sedan and the GR86 is a coupe. The Civic Si comes with a bit of practicality while the GR86 is one of the smallest vehicles on the market. The Civic Si comes with a turbocharged inline-four-cylinder engine while the GR86 utilizes a naturally aspirated flat-four setup. Unfortunately, neither Consumer Reports nor J.D. Power has reliability data specific to the Honda Civic Si. Because of that, we cannot fairly declare a winner in this matchup. J.D. Power awards the 2023 GR86 a 73 quality and reliability rating, and Consumer Reports gives it an average predicted reliability rating, but consistent historical data on this model is missing. Honda Civic Type R vs. Toyota GR Corolla Sadly, a conclusive winner in the hot hatchback reliability matchup will not be determined today, either. The Honda Civic Type-R is a fantastic driver‚Äôs car, hot off of a redesign for the 2023 model year. The new Toyota GR Corolla is a much anticipated all-wheel drive monster with a turbocharged three-cylinder engine. Both cars are a hoot to drive with the Type-R producing 315 horsepower and the GR Corolla making 300. Fortunately, both are also offered exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. Unfortunately, that still leaves our reliability winner undetermined. Toyota Hybrids vs. Honda Hybrids Toyota‚Äôs full lineup is much larger than Honda‚Äôs. Honda currently offers only two hybrid models: the Honda Accord Hybrid and CR-V Hybrid. We can compare these against the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the RAV4 Hybrid. The Camry Hybrid wins the head-to-head reliability battle against the Accord Hybrid, according to Consumer Reports data. Both vehicles have high reliability ratings, but where the Honda Accord Hybrid is rated above average since 2019, the Camry Hybrid has had a perfect CR reliability score since 2018, with the exception of 2020. There is not enough J.D. Power data to factor that into the competition. Moving on to the hybrid crossover competition, both the RAV4 and CR-V have above-average predictability scores from Consumer Reports. With the exception of a perfect reliability score for the RAV4 Hybrid in 2022, both vehicles are quite evenly matched in past years, according to Consumer Reports. The Toyota Prius, Prius Prime, Corolla Hybrid, Venza, RAV4 Prime, Corolla Cross Hybrid, Crown, Highlander Hybrid, and bZ4X round out Toyota‚Äôs other hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicles. Even though Honda does not have a direct competitor for these models, the star of the show is the Toyota Prius. It has been completely redesigned for 2023 with a predicted CR reliability score of 4/5. However, historical data shows impressive reliability scores of 5/5 from the 2011 model year to the 2022 model year. We have to give the reliable hybrid award to Toyota once again. Miscellaneous Models Honda does not offer a full-size pickup truck, a full-size SUV, or a true Toyota Supra competitor, but it is worth mentioning the Toyota Tundra and Toyota Sequoia. The Tundra was redesigned in 2022, and the Sequoia followed in 2023. That being said, J.D. Power has given the Tundra a quality and dependability rating of 70 for 2023, but the Sequoia remains unrated. Unfortunately, Consumer Reports also does not have sufficient reliability data to rate current or past Sequoia models, but the Tundra‚Äôs reliability scores may be surprising to you. Before it was redesigned, the Tundra earned above-average reliability ratings for most of its production years. In 2022, CR gave it a 2/5 rating, and its predicted reliability for 2023 is only average. How the Brands Stay on Top: Simplicity:Both Toyota and Honda focus on overall simplicity rather than complexity when they design most of the major components of their vehicles. Most of their models are fairly easy to work on when they do break, and neither is usually that expensive to fix if a part fails. Of course, modern technology is not as simple as it used to be, but compared to other manufacturers, they are about as simple as it gets. Quality Control:Both manufacturers are known for their robust quality control measures. Every car brand has its own quality control system in place, but Toyota‚Äôs Total Quality Management and Honda‚Äôs 120% Quality Control systems stand above most for ensuring that their vehicles get to the customer having been thoroughly examined. Engineering:Going hand-in-hand with simplicity, both automakers manufacture their vehicles with quality materials and uncomplicated design. These measures generally keep costs down while boosting longevity. A well-engineered engine and its components will require less long-term maintenance, make servicing easier when it is required, and decrease failure rates. Why Are They Different? No car brand is perfect, and not even the most reliable models are without at least one or two minor faults. It does beg the question of why everybody does not just do the same thing that the most traditionally reliable automaker does so that their vehicles are just as reliable. The answer to that is simple. Each automaker has a different design and manufacturing philosophy. Kia and Hyundai focus on value-oriented and feature-packed vehicles. BMW, of course, is a luxury car brand, but they also focus on driving experience as the ‚Äúultimate driving machine‚Äù. Mazda builds their vehicles around driver experience and feeling like you and your vehicle are one. Whether or not intentional, each manufacturer‚Äôs philosophy will affect how they build their cars, and ultimately, will play a role in how reliable they turn out to be. Though not always the case, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Land Rover are often cited as making some of the most unreliable vehicles in history. This is largely because there are more complicated features, and a greater number of features on these types of vehicles than others to make them luxurious. Complication does not inherently make a vehicle unreliable, but it does open the door for more things to go wrong. Another factor in the reliability equation is new technology. Advanced technology that gets added to vehicles goes through testing to make sure it works, but that technology is tested even further when it is actually used in the real world year after year. Automakers who are quick to adopt the newest technology often experience more growing pains than those who wait longer. Despite both being Japanese automakers Honda and Toyota also have different philosophies concerning the vehicles they produce, ultimately having an effect on how their vehicles feel, how they perform, and how reliable they are. They also share some of the same philosophies that have helped them produce reliable vehicles. More About Honda Vehicles: Honda started life as a motorcycle engine manufacturer in 1948, expanding to North America in 1959. It was not until 1963 that they started making automobiles. In 1982, they became the first Japanese automaker to produce vehicles in North America. They have a rich history of racing motorcycles and Formula 1 cars, and they have produced some of the most famous engines of all time. Honda cars are perhaps most famous for their four-cylinder engines. They used to be known for revving high and producing low torque figures, making it necessary to drive them hard at the limit. With stronger fuel economy restrictions currently in place, Honda has replaced high revs for turbochargers in most of their four-cylinder applications. Their six-cylinder engines are good too. In fact, the J-Series engine that they still use in the Pilot, Odyssey, Ridgeline, and Passport has been around in some form or fashion since 1996. Honda models tend to be practical, spacious, and stylish vehicles that often fall near or at the top of their respective segments in passenger space, cargo space, and safety ratings. Interior styling, a robust standard safety features list, and fuel economy are stand-out areas in most of their vehicles. They currently offer a 3-year/36,000-mile limited warranty and a 5-year/60,000 powertrain warranty on all of their new cars. More About Toyota Vehicles: The Toyota Motor Company was established in 1937. Unlike Honda, they started manufacturing vehicles from their inception, but it was not until 1957 that the first Toyota car made it to North America. In 1989, Toyota expanded its market reach, launching the Lexus luxury brand and the LS 400 as its first vehicle. Toyota, like Honda, has a history in racing, but it is not as extensive and takes a different form than its top competitor. Toyota‚Äôs top racing success has come in the form of off-road racing, rally racing, and NASCAR racing. Toyota has even had multiple stints in endurance racing, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Toyota is known for making well-designed, simple, and overengineered engines. The legendary 2JZ-GTE engine, found in the Mk IV Supra, is perhaps the most well-known. It is highly sought after for its tuning potential, known to be able to produce two to three times more power than its factory output with bolt-on upgrades and little to no modifications to its stock powertrain components. The GR series of engines is used in several applications from the early 2000s to now, with the current Toyota 4Runner utilizing the 1GR-FE. This version, in particular, is considered to be inefficient, outdated, unrefined, and noisy compared to more modern engines, but it is known to be one of the most reliable powerplants on the market because of those things. Other Toyota models have also had great success utilizing various inline four-cylinder engines, inline-six-cylinder engines, and V8 engine applications throughout history. Toyota makes vehicles that are considered to be somewhat boring to drive and less technologically advanced than other models from competing manufacturers. They prefer to wait until a technology is more proven before utilizing it in their vehicles, one of several reasons that their reputation for reliability is so robust. Practicality is prized over flashy design. Each new Toyota comes with a 3-year/36,000 basic warranty and a 6-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty on all of their new cars.

These two have duked it out for decades, the battle making each a more enticing blend of comfort, performance, and economy. Fresh from a redesign for the 2023 model year, the 2024 Accord continues to impress, highlighted by its driving dynamics, passenger space, cargo volume, and user-friendly infotainment system. A turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder serves as the base engine and is coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Optional is a 2.0-liter gas-electric hybrid 4-cylinder that returns a fantastic EPA-rated 48 mpg combined. This generation of Camry dates back to the 2018 model year, but don‚Äôt think that makes it a pushover in this comparison. It‚Äôs also extremely comfortable, easy to drive, and offers the bonus of an optional V6 or all-wheel drive. Neither are available in the Accord. The 2024 Camry‚Äôs base engine, a 203-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that teams with an 8-speed automatic, is dutiful and frugal. A hybrid version of the Camry helps you squeeze more miles out of a tank of gas. It‚Äôs rated by the EPA at up to 52 mpg combined. Let‚Äôs explore highlights of the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. 2024 Honda Accord The Honda Accord LX and EX trims are fitted with the standard turbo 1.5-liter powertrain, while all others ‚Äî Sport, EX-L, Sport-L, and Touring ‚Äî feature the smooth-running hybrid powertrain. Each is a smart choice, though some car shoppers might be okay with sacrificing some fuel economy for a lower base price. The Accord LX starts at $27,895. The least expensive hybrid Accord, the Sport, begins at $32,545. Honda Accord Highlights Honda Sensing: This suite of active driver aids, fitted to every 2024 Accord, includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane-keep assist, and lane-departure warning. The latest Honda Accord earns the Top Safety Pick+ status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Passenger space, cargo volume: The 2024 Honda Accord has an airy and spacious cabin with excellent outward visibility. This is thanks in part to slim front A-pillars that frame the windshield. The Accord‚Äôs 40.8 inches of rear legroom, plus its 16.7 cubic-foot trunk, are greater than what you get in the Camry. User-friendly tech: In addition to its abundant standard safety features, the base Accord LX comes with an easy-to-use 7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 10.2-inch digital instrument display, automatic climate control, and multiple USB outlets. Accord Hybrid models boast an even more impressive 12.3-inch screen. Check this week‚Äôs Fair Purchase Price or see the Accord models for sale near you. 2024 Toyota Camry The Toyota Camry is like a star pupil among midsize sedans, the standard by which other competitors are compared. Eight trims are offered with the standard powertrain, and five are available with the hybrid. As the least expensive means of Camry ownership, the LE trim starts at $26,420. All-wheel drive adds about $1,400 to the price. Toyota Camry Highlights Available V6 or AWD: The Camry‚Äôs got a few notable features not offered on the Accord‚Äôs option sheet: a potent V6 engine, and all-wheel drive on 4-cylinder models. The former, a 3.5-liter V6, delivers a stout 302 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque, giving the mild-mannered Camry a serious kick when you punch the gas. The V6 is optional in the XLE and XSE and standard in the sporty TRD trim. All-wheel drive is optional on 4-cylinder Camry models, starting with the base LE trim. Easygoing driving manners: Most Camry shoppers stick with the tried-and-true 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. That‚Äôs fine because this engine gets the job done in terms of providing reasonable acceleration and solid fuel economy figures. Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+: Like the Accord, Toyota groups together many safety features under one banner. Standard on every Camry, Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ brings with it forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, intersection assistance, rear-seat reminder, lane-keep assist, and more. The Camry also earns the Top Safety Pick+ honor from the IIHS. Check this week‚Äôs Fair Purchase Price or see the Camry models for sale near you. Similarities Where to begin? The Accord and Camry prove that midsize sedans remain a viable alternative to the everything-SUV herd mentality. Both are made in the U.S. and have identical warranties. Both are dependable and deliver loads of value and excellent resale. They‚Äôre also easy to maneuver and gentle on your fuel budget, thanks to manageable overall proportions and finely engineered powertrains. Conclusions Plain and simple, the Accord and Camry are both excellent picks. But they do have some key respective advantages. For example, you get a roomier rear seat and larger trunk with the Accord. But the optional all-wheel drive and that potent V6 available in the Camry may swing the pendulum back in the Toyota‚Äôs direction. Remember: The newly updated Accord recently took home a Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award as our Best Midsize Car of 2024. In addition to having more space to stretch out and extra luggage room, the 2024 Accord shines with an overall sophistication not quite matched by the Toyota.

And plug-in hybrids were worse. The Toyota 4Runner was last redesigned for the 2009 model year ‚Äî and was the most reliable vehicle in the survey. There could be a lesson in those results. New technologies tend to be less reliable than proven technologies. But the Consumer Reports‚Äô 2023 Auto Reliability Survey headline is still jarring. ‚ÄúOn average, new electric vehicles have 79% more problems than Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles,‚Äù CR reports. Plug-in hybrids, the halfway point between the two capable of using electricity for short trips and gas for long trips, performed even worse in the survey. Those, CR says, have 146% more problems than ICE vehicles. Consumer Reports‚Äô approach is unique Consumer Reports‚Äô rankings differ from most automotive reliability studies because CR polls its members. This has advantages and disadvantages. Related: The 10 most unreliable vehicles for 2024, according to Consumer Reports Only a certain kind of consumer subscribes to a publication that exists to study reliability and sound buying decisions. That may leave some brands overrepresented and others nearly absent from CR‚Äôs poll. But the data is extensive for the cars it does represent. Laws give automakers the right to opt out of studies in some states, but the nature of CR‚Äôs surveys gets around that problem. Tesla TSLA, which famously refuses to participate in many quality studies, appears in CR‚Äôs results. The magazine asks its members to report problems they‚Äôve had with their cars in the last 12 months. It only reports results for vehicles from model years 2001 through 2024. This year, it studied more than 330,000 individual vehicles. Nearly every automaker did better than last year. Also see: 9 cars, trucks and SUVS that are finalists for 2024 North American car of the year Lexus, Toyota did very well Of the top 10 most reliable brands, seven are headquartered in Asia, with Lexus and Toyota in the top two spots, CR says. Every Lexus model but one ‚Äì the NX ‚Äì had above-average reliability. The aging Toyota TM 4Runner ‚Äì last redesigned for the 2009 model year ‚Äì was the most reliable vehicle in the survey. Check out: Toyota is making this new SUV with the Crown name: When can you get one? The scores: Newness, complexity are issues There‚Äôs a lesson in the 4Runner‚Äôs strong score. It may even explain the EV results. Cars are complex machines. It takes time for automakers to find all the flaws in a design and correct them. ‚ÄúAnd as our data has consistently shown, reliability-minded consumers would be best served by forgoing brand new vehicles in their first model year,‚Äù explains Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for CR. That same logic applies not just to individual models but to technologies. CR calls the troubling scores of EVs ‚Äúgrowing pains.‚Äù With well-established batteries and electric motors that have been on the market for years now, Tesla has ‚Äúissues with body hardware, paint and trim, and climate system on its models.‚Äù Other EV builders working with the technology for less time ‚Äúhad fewer reported problems related to build quality, but higher rates of powertrain, battery, and charging issues,‚Äù CR explains. And plug-in hybrids, with essentially two powertrains, take more time to perfect. More parts mean more things that can go wrong. Hybrids a bright spot EVs and PHEVs experienced more problems than gas-powered cars in CR‚Äôs survey. Hybrids experienced less. On average, hybrids are 26% more reliable than vehicles with only an internal combustion engine, CR explained. ‚ÄúThis is because hybrid technology is now over 25 years old and is offered mainly from the most reliable automakers,‚Äù Fisher says. Hybrid sales have been rising throughout 2023 as many Americans seek a way to save on gasoline without tying themselves to a new technology experiencing growing pains.

But which one makes better vehicles for the 2023 model year? Let\'s take a look. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. and American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Clash of the Titans Toyota and Honda make vehicles that rule the sales charts. For example, in 2022, Toyota had the best-selling SUV in the land with its RAV4, and the brand\'s Camry sedan was the best-selling car. Honda had the second best-selling SUV with its CR-V, and its Accord was the second best-selling midsize sedan behind the Camry. Advertisement Both brands make vehicles that hit the sweet spot for many buyers, offering an appealing mix of quality and value. But though these Japanese automakers are similar in the success they\'ve achieved, each has a unique vehicle lineup with individual strengths and weaknesses. So which brand has a stronger range of vehicles? To find out, we\'ve compared Toyota and Honda vehicles by segment using each model\'s U.S. News overall score. Advertisement A vehicle\'s U.S. News overall score combines its ratings for performance, interior, reliability and safety, providing a complete picture of what a car has to offer. The brand whose vehicles have the higher average score in each segment wins that round, and the brand with the most segment wins takes the crown in our showdown. We update the scores on our site as new expert reviews and data become available. Therefore, the scores mentioned in this slideshow may differ from those in our reviews. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Small Cars Winner: Honda Toyota has a range of small cars that includes value-oriented, fuel-efficient choices. First is the Corolla, which has an 8.0 overall score from U.S. News. It\'s been on the market for decades and is the world\'s best-selling car; the 2023 model offers a smooth ride and lots of standard equipment. If you like the Corolla but want better fuel economy, the Corolla Hybrid (7.8 overall score) will fit the bill. Advertisement Toyota\'s lineup of small cars also includes the Prius (7.7). This model has hybrid powertrains that deliver exceptional fuel economy. In addition, there\'s the Prius Prime (8.1), the plug-in hybrid version of the Prius. Honda keeps things streamlined, offering just one car in this category. The Civic (8.7) is a standard-bearer among compact cars, offering a relaxed ride, an upscale cabin and strong fuel economy. Advertisement The Civic\'s high score beats the average score of Toyota\'s candidates in this segment, so Honda wins this round. More on the 2023 Honda Civic American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Midsize Cars Winner: Honda Toyota and Honda make midsize cars that helped put these brands on the map. Advertisement Honda has achieved sales success with the Accord (8.4), a model that was redesigned for 2023. The Accord provides ample room for passengers, and its cabin has a premium appearance. It also offers a poised ride that makes it an excellent choice for drivers seeking a comfortable commuter vehicle. The Accord Hybrid (8.6) is the hybrid version of this popular family car. Toyota offers the popular Camry (8.2), a sedan with a cushioned ride and spacious seats. Though it has below-average trunk capacity, the Camry impresses with its lively optional V6. The Camry Hybrid (8.5) is this model\'s hybrid version, delivering impressive fuel economy. Advertisement Honda has the higher average score in this segment and takes the win. More on the 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Large Cars Winner: Toyota For years, Toyota\'s biggest car was the Avalon. The automaker has discontinued that car, replacing it with the Crown (6.0), which debuted for the 2023 model year. The Crown has a hybrid powertrain, and all models have all-wheel drive. Advertisement All Crown sedans come standard with a 12.3-inch touch screen, wireless device charging, satellite radio, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The optional features include a panoramic sunroof and an 11-speaker JBL sound system. This full-size sedan has tight headroom, however, and there\'s little steering feedback. Its strengths include an optional powertrain that delivers eager acceleration. Advertisement Honda doesn\'t make a full-size car, so Toyota wins this round. More on the 2023 Toyota Crown Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Sports Cars Winner: Toyota Toyota makes a sports car, but Honda doesn\'t. So that means Toyota comes out on top in this category. Advertisement Toyota\'s entry in this class is the GR86, a nameplate that debuted for the 2022 model year. The GR86 earned an overall score of 8.3 from U.S. News. It offers responsive handling and energetic acceleration. However, road noise reaches the cabin, and the back seat is tight. This four-passenger car has a four-cylinder engine with 228 horsepower and is available with a manual or automatic transmission. That engine helps the GR86 sprint from zero to 60 mph in 6 seconds. Advertisement Base models have an 8-inch touch screen, satellite radio, a six-speaker stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition, an eight-speaker stereo is optional. More on the 2023 Toyota GR86 Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Luxury Sports Cars Winner: Toyota Toyota isn\'t a traditional luxury brand, but it makes a sports car plush enough to compete with models from brands including Jaguar and BMW. The Supra is the brand\'s car in this segment, earning an overall score of 8.2 from U.S. News. Advertisement The Supra offers quick acceleration and a handsome cabin, and it costs less than sports cars from premium brands. This car\'s base four-cylinder engine has 255 horsepower, and an optional six-cylinder power plant with 382 horsepower is available. You can choose between manual and automatic transmissions. Advertisement Toyota\'s Supra dashes from zero to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds with the six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission. The Supra comes standard with features such as an 8.8-inch infotainment display, satellite radio and dual-zone automatic climate control. Honda doesn\'t make a luxury sports car, so Toyota gets the nod in this round. More on the 2023 Toyota Supra American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Hybrid Cars Winner: Honda Toyota offers many options for drivers seeking a hybrid car. The Camry Hybrid (8.5) is a good choice if you\'re looking for a cushioned ride and excellent gas mileage. It also won our 2023 Best Hybrid Cars for Families award. There\'s also the Prius (7.7), a car with many standard features and fuel economy that\'s among the best in the class. The Prius Prime (8.1) is for drivers who want a plug-in hybrid with energetic acceleration. Lastly, the Crown (6.0) is a full-size car with standard all-wheel drive. Advertisement Honda\'s sole car in this class is the Accord Hybrid, a refined, roomy sedan. The Accord Hybrid\'s 8.6 overall score beats the average score of Toyota\'s hybrids, so Honda comes out on top in this segment. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid John M Vincent/U.S. News and World Report Small SUVs Winner: Honda Toyota buyers have a choice of several small SUVs. The RAV4 (8.1), RAV4 Hybrid (8.2) and RAV4 Prime (8.1) are comfortable and fuel-efficient. The Corolla Cross (7.7) and Corolla Cross Hybrid (7.2) offer good fuel economy for those seeking a subcompact SUV. And the brand\'s bZ4X (6.7) is a small all-electric SUV with a modern cabin and many safety features. Advertisement Honda offers the CR-V (8.4) and CR-V Hybrid (8.3), which have upmarket cabins and appealing standard equipment. Next is the HR-V (8.1), a subcompact SUV with an impressive interior and user-friendly infotainment system. Honda\'s higher average score makes it the victor in this round. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda CR-V Hybrid American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Midsize SUVs Winner: Honda Toyota\'s range of midsize SUVs includes the Highlander (7.9) and Highlander Hybrid (8.1). These three-row SUVs seat up to eight people and offer pleasant handling and attractive standard equipment. The brand\'s two-row midsize SUV is the 4Runner (7.0), a model with lots of cargo room and excellent off-road skills. The Venza (7.6) has a frugal hybrid powertrain. Advertisement Honda gives buyers the Passport (8.2), which has a capable V6. There\'s also the Pilot (8.2), a roomy three-row SUV that was fully redesigned for 2023. Honda\'s superior average score gives it a win in this segment. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda Passport Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Large SUVs Winner: Toyota Toyota\'s entry in the large SUV segment is the Sequoia (7.2). You can configure this model to seat seven or eight passengers. It has a relatively tight third row and less cargo room than key peers, however. On a positive note, the Sequoia provides a relaxed ride and a peppy hybrid powertrain. Advertisement The Sequoia\'s powertrain produces 437 horsepower and a whopping 583 pound-feet of torque. A 10-speed automatic transmission shifts the gears. Base models come with rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive is available. Honda doesn\'t make a large SUV, so that makes Toyota the victor in this round. Advertisement More on the 2023 Toyota Sequoia American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Hybrid and Electric SUVs Winner: Honda Toyota offers buyers in this segment the RAV4 Hybrid (8.2) and RAV4 Prime (8.1), models with a gentle ride and a well-built cabin. There\'s also the Highlander Hybrid (8.1), which was the winner of our Best Hybrid SUV for Families and the Venza (7.6), which provides upscale transportation. Next is the bZ4X (6.7), Toyota\'s sole all-electric model. The brand\'s final vehicle in this class is the Corolla Cross Hybrid (7.2), a small SUV with superb gas mileage. Advertisement Honda competes in this category with the CR-V Hybrid. This compact SUV has a roomy cabin and pleasant handling. It earned an overall score of 8.3 from U.S. News; that\'s higher than the average score of Toyota\'s vehicles in this class, so Honda is the champ in this portion of the showdown. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda CR-V Hybrid American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Minivans Winner: Honda The Toyota Sienna (8.0) has some good things working in its favor. First, it comes standard with a hybrid powertrain that delivers impressive mileage, so it\'s a great choice for commuting. Also, this minivan is available with all-wheel drive; that feature gives it added traction that can be a godsend in rain or snow. Lastly, the Sienna has impressive safety features such as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Advertisement Still, while the Sienna has much to offer, it can\'t touch the Honda Odyssey, which has an overall U.S. News score of 9.0. Versatile and comfortable, the Odyssey won two of our awards in this class: 2023 Best Minivan for the Money and 2023 Best Minivan for Families. The Odyssey earns Honda the gold in this category. Keep in mind, though, that, unlike the Sienna, Honda\'s minivan isn\'t available with all-wheel drive. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda Odyssey American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Trucks Winner: Honda Toyota targets buyers with two trucks. The Tacoma (7.2) is the brand\'s compact pickup. It has many standard features, which help add value. Also, its TRD trims are capable, rugged choices for off-roading. Toyota\'s full-size truck is the Tundra (8.1). Though it has a below-average payload rating, the Tundra impresses with its potent engine range and refined ride. Advertisement Honda doesn\'t make a full-size truck but offers the Ridgeline (8.4), one of the best compact pickups you can buy. The Ridgeline is less off-road-friendly than rivals such as the Tacoma. It makes up for this with its poised ride and upmarket interior, however. The Ridgeline has a higher score than the average of Toyota\'s two trucks, so Honda wins again. Advertisement More on the 2023 Honda Ridgeline American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Winner Is ‚Ä¶ Honda The good news for Toyota is that the brand nabbed some wins in this showdown. The Sequoia helped the brand prevail in the large SUVs category, and the Supra scored a victory in the luxury sports cars segment. Toyota also won for sports cars and large cars. The bad news is that those wins were achieved by default; no Honda vehicles competed in the four categories that Toyota won. Advertisement That makes Honda the winner of this showdown by a landslide. The excellent Civic gave the brand a win in the small cars category. Honda also won for midsize cars, hybrid cars and small SUVs. Honda also triumphs for trucks, minivans, hybrid and electric SUVs, and midsize SUVs. Though it lost this showdown, Toyota vehicles are popular with buyers and sometimes outsell their Honda rivals.

For new car shoppers, finding the right brand is very important. There are a lot of choices out there, and a common comparison is one between Honda and Toyota. The two Japanese auto companies are popular brands, and if you\'ve been looking for a new car, there\'s a good chance you\'ve seen these two brands pop up. There are a lot of important factors that come into play when making a car purchase, both used and new. Reliability and dependability are a top priority for a lot of people. Nobody likes taking their car in for repairs or having to worry about something breaking down. Luckily, both Honda and Toyota have a lot of reliable options in each lineup for people who are looking. It\'s tough to go wrong with either of the brands, but there are some small things to look for that could end up pushing you one way or the other. Comparing the Honda and Toyota lineups In order to get a clear picture, it\'s important to look at the comparable models. For the flagship economy cars, we\'ll look at the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla. You can\'t really go wrong with either of these options: Looking at J.D. Power, the Civic comes in with an 80/100 score in quality and reliability. However, the Corolla tops that with an 85/100 score, meaning it gets the edge there in points. That being said, the numbers are so close that it\'s almost negligible. The Civic does top the Corolla in overall score by a single point at 82, compared to 81. Moving on to the crossover SUV market, we\'re going to look at how the Honda CR-V stacks up against the Toyota RAV4. The CR-V checks in with a score of 82 in reliability, and an 81 overall score according to J.D. Power. The RAV-4 has an 81 score in reliability, but it finishes a point ahead in overall score with an 82. Again, it\'s a negligible difference that could really just be a toss-up. In pickup truck territory, we have the Toyota Tacoma pitted against the Honda Ridgeline. The Tacoma finishes with an 83 reliability score and an 82 overall from J.D. Power. The Ridgeline lags behind just a bit with an 80 in both reliability and overall score. At the end of the day, we see the Toyota offering take the slight victory in two of the three reliability comparisons. Honda or Toyota: Which ends up on top? While the Toyota models ever-so-slightly did reign supreme over the Honda ones, the scores are so close that it ultimately comes down to personal preference. With both brands being quite reliable for long-term vehicle ownership, you\'ll instead have to turn toward factors like cost and availability. Both have excellent products available, so it\'s not like you can go wrong with any vehicle from both. Both manufacturers come with similar warranties on new models as well. A new Toyota boasts a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a six-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty, while Honda drops it to a five-year powertrain warranty at the same mileage. With the used car market beginning to balance out, picking up a pre-owned vehicle isn\'t a bad option either. Reliability ultimately means less repair costs, so you shouldn\'t have to be all that concerned about picking up a five-year-old model, even if it doesn\'t have particularly low mileage.\n Using the above text, summarize it based on the following task or query: "honda vs toyota".\n If the query cannot be answered using the text, YOU MUST summarize the text in short.\n Include all factual information such as numbers, stats, quotes, etc if available.

The better choice is going to come down to which you think feels and drives better. Is Honda Or Toyota More Reliable? Toyota emphasizes reliability and dependability, which implies that it takes time to introduce the latest technology and integrate cutting-edge features. However, some of Toyota\'s redesigned models have electronic and mechanical issues. On the other hand, Honda\'s models, such as Insight and Civic, are fuel-efficient, offer expansive cabins, and have solid safety ratings. Honda\'s reliability in the small car segments is higher than Toyota.
