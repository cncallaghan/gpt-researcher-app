Honda/Toyota Article QuickTakes You‚Äôve whittled your list down to the most popular compact sedans: the 2022 Honda Civic and the 2022 Toyota Corolla. Deciding between these two cars takes more than a flip of a coin. We‚Äôre here to help look at the numbers ‚Äî and the features ‚Äî that separate these top four-door choices. Honda Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Price Including destination charges, pricing for the front-wheel drive, five-passenger 2022 Corolla sedan starts with the $21,200 L trim that gets a 1.8L four-cylinder gas engine and an automatic transmission. The optional 2L engine in the Corolla SE bumps its price to $23,650, and the gas-electric Hybrid trim starts at $24,775. Also with room for five and power only to its front wheels, the base 2022 Civic Sedan LX gets a 2.0L four-cylinder engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission, and costs $23,365, while the optional turbocharged 1.5L four-cylinder starts in the $26,365 Civic EX trim. Opting for a manual transmission means spending $23,650 for a Corolla SE or stepping up to the sporty $28,315 Civic Si. Check all the boxes, and Toyota asks $29,385 for a fully-equipped Corolla XSE Apex Edition, while Honda charges $29,965 for a Civic Touring. Honda Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Features These cars are anything but basic. The latest Civic and Corolla come standard with a host of airbags, power features, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, touchscreen infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and LED exterior lighting. The Civic Sedan comes in six configurations: LX, Sport, EX, Touring, Si, and Si HPT, with no individual optional extras. Toyota offers five trim levels of the Corolla Sedan: L, LE, XLE, SE, XSE, plus the Apex and Nightshade special editions. All but the L are offered with option packages that bundle popular features. To add a moonroof, step up to the Civic EX or add an option package to the Corolla LE. Honda makes leather seats standard on the Civic Touring, while Toyota offers synthetic leatherette upholstery on Corolla XLE and XSE. Only leatherette-trimmed Corollas come with heated front seats, something Honda includes on the Civic EX and Touring. Premium audio is another story. The Civic Touring and Si HPT come with a 12-speaker Bose system, while The nine-speaker JBL system is available on most Corollas. Navigation and a wireless charging pad are optional on Corolla XLE and XSE. They are standard on the Civic Touring but unavailable otherwise. Drivers seeking sportier handling will find a firmer ride quality on the Corolla XSE Apex Edition, while the Civic Si goes farther with a more dedicated performance-oriented suspension and high-performance tires with the Si HPT trim. Toyota Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Fuel Economy The Toyota Corolla Hybrid has a clear fuel economy lead with its 1.8L gas engine/dual-electric motor powertrain, which offers Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) city/highway estimates of 53/52 mpg. With 121 horsepower, however, that hybrid powertrain may leave some drivers wanting. The Corolla‚Äôs base 139-hp engine scores as high as 30/38 mpg (L, LE). The optional 160-hp engine drops consumption to as low as 28/36 mpg (manual SE) and as high as 31/40 mpg (auto SE). The Honda Civic‚Äôs 158-hp engine is rated as high as 31/40 mpg, while the 158-hp turbocharged option is thriftier at 33/42 mpg. The Civic Si puts out 200 hp, rated at 27/37 mpg. One caveat: fuel economy ratings for both cars vary by trim level, so shop closely if you are trying to minimize consumption.

Chandler‚Äôs passion and knowledge of the automotive industry help him deliver high-quality, insightful content to TuningPro readers. It seems like a question as old as time, who makes the better automobile, Honda or Toyota? For decades, the two Japanese auto manufacturers have been dominating the U.S. market with their ultra-reliable, high-quality, and low-cost automobiles. Among consumers, they are widely known as two of the most dependable brands on the market, and it is for very good reason. Both Honda and Toyota have built their reputations over years of hard work and development. But which is truly the better brand for reliability? Some will tell you Honda, while others swear by Toyota, and today we‚Äôre gonna figure it out. Honda vs Toyota reliability, which is truly the best? Make sure to check out our other Toyota and Honda content. For Honda, this includes our Best Honda Engines of All Time, 5 Best Honda Accord Mods, Honda B16 vs B18 Engine Guide, and Honda K24 Turbo Upgrade Guide. For Toyota, we have the Best Toyota Engines of All Time, Toyota‚Äôs reliability history, Ultimate Toyota 3S-GTE Upgrades, Best and Worst Years for Tacoma Trucks, and our 1GZ-FE V12 guide. Honda vs Toyota Reliability, The History Honda and Toyota might be two of the biggest and most successful Japanese auto manufacturers today. However, they had some very different ways of getting there. Toyota got their start back in the late-19th century, when family patriarch Sakichi Toyoda started building hand looms. Later, in the 1930s, he switched to developing automobiles and engines. He soon conceived the Toyoda Motor Company, which later changed its name to Toyota. It was in the 1950s that Toyota first started selling automobiles on the U.S. market. In contrast, Honda‚Äôs history dates back to the 1930s, when founder Soichiro Honda began making piston rings for, of all people, the Toyoda Motor Company. However, somewhat ironically now, his quality was not up to par and Toyoda stopped working with him shortly after. By the 1940s, however, Honda had recovered. In 1948, he founded the Honda Motor Company, originally making bicycles with auxiliary engines. They soon began making motorcycles, and in the 1960s they ventured into the automobile market. Honda had already come stateside in 1959, making a big name for themselves on the American market. By the 1980s, both Honda and Toyota were among the most popular and consistent car brands among Americans. Not widely known for their performance or luxury in terms of production cars, they both made a name for themselves by producing inexpensive and fuel-efficient motors that would last forever and were cheap to operate. Behind the scenes, their racing pedigrees gave them ample time to test out new concepts, some of which would eventually make their way on major roadways. Today, Honda and Toyota always rank at the top of dependability and trustworthiness scales, and they are practically unmatched with their brand loyalty and allegiance. Honda vs Toyota: Reliability Both Honda vs Toyota market their vehicles as being very capable and durable, and it‚Äôs not just talk. Hondas and Toyotas have a reputation among mechanics pretty much everywhere for being built to last. That‚Äôs not to say that they have no problems and have never had any duds, but for the most part when you buy a Honda or a Toyota you can typically depend on at least a few things, including it to last 250,000+ miles with proper maintenance, cheap operating costs, good fuel efficiency, and an economic sticker price. But how exactly have Honda vs Toyota achieved such reputations? Toyota‚Äôs Secret to Reliability For Toyota, as part of Toyota‚Äôs history of reliability, they have a very important manufacturing and creation process they call the Toyota Production System or TPS. The TPS consists of 15 different pillars that all help them streamline and improve every part of the building process. These range from ‚ÄúAndon,‚Äù which means they can bring production to a stop to highlight potential problems. To ‚ÄúPoka-Yoke,‚Äù which refers to the failsafe devices they have that help mistake-proof the process. In addition to TPS, Toyota also has three major reasons for maintaining such a high level of proficiency and dependability: Their cars and engines are underpowered but overengineered, they promote practicality over performance, and they have an absolute wealth of experience in several different automotive and technological facets. As far as being underpowered but overengineered, it‚Äôs pretty common knowledge that Toyota builds their engines to be capable of way more performance than they give them. For example, most of their engines only make around 200-250 horsepower. However, most of these same engines can easily handle 300+ horsepower given their stout internals, they are just horribly detuned from the factory. Toyota does that so they will last forever without needing a rebuild, and it seems to work pretty well. In the same vein, they also clearly focus on practicality over performance. Most of their models are economy or mid-tier offerings, and they really save most high-end marketing for the luxury Lexus brand. When you buy a Toyota you know what you are getting, something functional, predictable, and pragmatic. Toyota has been building cars for nearly a century, and they definitely know what works and what doesn‚Äôt by now. They have dominated the worldwide car industry for decades and show no signs of slowing down. Honda‚Äôs Secret to Reliability Honda‚Äôs path to reliability was much different than Toyota‚Äôs, but it was not any less effective. While Honda does not have a fancy pillared TPS system like Toyota does, they do have their own process that actually incorporates some of the same concepts. These include ‚ÄúKaizen,‚Äù which means continuous improvement or good change. Kaizen refers to the process of Honda employees always giving feedback to help make sure the system functions as efficiently as possible. They also utilize JIT, or Just-in-Time, meaning everything is built on-time and per order, reducing waste and saving money. Additionally, Honda has a hybrid production line that has both robotic machinery and humans, which is also similar to Toyota. Humans are able to perform quality control and inspection checks to make sure the robotics are performing optimally. If a Honda employee notices something is going south, or likewise that there is room for improvement, they can stop the machine until a solution is discovered and implemented. This again helps to reduce unnecessary waste and save money. Honda also has a very extensive motorsports history, which they have used as a proving ground of sorts for many of their products. From building early rally cars to competing in Formula 1, Honda has long been a big name in auto racing. Some of the suspension and engine components they have used to win them racing championships have later found their way into passenger cars that now haul families to and from the grocery store. Which is More Reliable? So, Honda vs Toyota, which is truly the more reliable manufacturer? While it‚Äôs certainly close, most people would give the edge to Toyota. Toyota has been building cars a little bit longer, and they were the first Asian car manufacturer to truly make it big stateside. As a result, they still rank the highest today among consumers for the most reliable brand. Part of this is brand loyalty, as many buyers purchased a Toyota decades ago and have stayed with them for new cars, but it‚Äôs hard to argue with the results. In 2021, Toyota became the number one selling auto manufacturer for the U.S. market, making more than 2.3 million vehicles (according to CNBC). This was a monumental accomplishment, and really shows just how popular they are. Honda sold less than half the amount Toyota did in the U.S. Furthermore, just looking at Car and Driver‚Äôs list of the best selling cars for 2022, it‚Äôs easy to see why Toyota rates so high. They have two cars in the top five, three in the top 10, and five in the top 20. In contrast, Honda has one in the top 10 and only two in the top 25, total. It‚Äôs very close, but we have to give Toyota the edge on this one. Honda vs Toyota: Reliability, Summary Overall, Honda and Toyota are two of the most reliable brands in the world. They ooze dependability and durability, and there is a reason they are two of the biggest selling brands around the world. Yet, of the two, we would have to say that Toyota is just a little bit higher on the reliability scale. They have been building cars for longer, build a lot more every year, and in general seem to rate higher for most consumers. That‚Äôs not to say that Honda is bad, but they just can‚Äôt compete with Toyota‚Äôs reputation and standing. Honda vs Toyota: Reliability, FAQ In terms of Honda vs Toyota, we would have to say that Toyota is just a little bit higher on the reliability scale. They have been building cars for longer, build a lot more every year, and in general seem to rate higher for most consumers. That‚Äôs not to say that Honda is bad, but they just can‚Äôt compete with Toyota‚Äôs reputation and standing. Toyota is more reliable than Honda because they build more cars and have been doing so for longer. Toyota easily builds more than double the cars Honda does for the American market, and they are much more popular. In 2021, Toyota became the top selling auto manufacturer for the U.S. market, showing their popularity.

Honda/Toyota Article QuickTakes You‚Äôve whittled your list down to the most popular compact sedans: the 2022 Honda Civic and the 2022 Toyota Corolla. Deciding between these two cars takes more than a flip of a coin. We‚Äôre here to help look at the numbers ‚Äî and the features ‚Äî that separate these top four-door choices. Honda Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Price Including destination charges, pricing for the front-wheel drive, five-passenger 2022 Corolla sedan starts with the $21,200 L trim that gets a 1.8L four-cylinder gas engine and an automatic transmission. The optional 2L engine in the Corolla SE bumps its price to $23,650, and the gas-electric Hybrid trim starts at $24,775. Also with room for five and power only to its front wheels, the base 2022 Civic Sedan LX gets a 2.0L four-cylinder engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission, and costs $23,365, while the optional turbocharged 1.5L four-cylinder starts in the $26,365 Civic EX trim. Opting for a manual transmission means spending $23,650 for a Corolla SE or stepping up to the sporty $28,315 Civic Si. Check all the boxes, and Toyota asks $29,385 for a fully-equipped Corolla XSE Apex Edition, while Honda charges $29,965 for a Civic Touring. Honda Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Features These cars are anything but basic. The latest Civic and Corolla come standard with a host of airbags, power features, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, touchscreen infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and LED exterior lighting. The Civic Sedan comes in six configurations: LX, Sport, EX, Touring, Si, and Si HPT, with no individual optional extras. Toyota offers five trim levels of the Corolla Sedan: L, LE, XLE, SE, XSE, plus the Apex and Nightshade special editions. All but the L are offered with option packages that bundle popular features. To add a moonroof, step up to the Civic EX or add an option package to the Corolla LE. Honda makes leather seats standard on the Civic Touring, while Toyota offers synthetic leatherette upholstery on Corolla XLE and XSE. Only leatherette-trimmed Corollas come with heated front seats, something Honda includes on the Civic EX and Touring. Premium audio is another story. The Civic Touring and Si HPT come with a 12-speaker Bose system, while The nine-speaker JBL system is available on most Corollas. Navigation and a wireless charging pad are optional on Corolla XLE and XSE. They are standard on the Civic Touring but unavailable otherwise. Drivers seeking sportier handling will find a firmer ride quality on the Corolla XSE Apex Edition, while the Civic Si goes farther with a more dedicated performance-oriented suspension and high-performance tires with the Si HPT trim. Toyota Honda Civic vs. Toyota Corolla: Fuel Economy The Toyota Corolla Hybrid has a clear fuel economy lead with its 1.8L gas engine/dual-electric motor powertrain, which offers Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) city/highway estimates of 53/52 mpg. With 121 horsepower, however, that hybrid powertrain may leave some drivers wanting. The Corolla‚Äôs base 139-hp engine scores as high as 30/38 mpg (L, LE). The optional 160-hp engine drops consumption to as low as 28/36 mpg (manual SE) and as high as 31/40 mpg (auto SE). The Honda Civic‚Äôs 158-hp engine is rated as high as 31/40 mpg, while the 158-hp turbocharged option is thriftier at 33/42 mpg. The Civic Si puts out 200 hp, rated at 27/37 mpg. One caveat: fuel economy ratings for both cars vary by trim level, so shop closely if you are trying to minimize consumption.

It seems like a question as old as time, who makes the better automobile, Honda or Toyota? For decades, the two Japanese auto manufacturers have been dominating the U.S. market with their ultra-reliable, high-quality, and low-cost automobiles. Among consumers, they are widely known as two of the most dependable brands on the market, and it is for very good reason. Both Honda and Toyota have built their reputations over years of hard work and development. But which is truly the better brand for reliability? Some will tell you Honda, while others swear by Toyota, and today we‚Äôre gonna figure it out. Honda vs Toyota reliability, which is truly the best?

For Toyota, we have the Best Toyota Engines of All Time, Toyota‚Äôs reliability history, Ultimate Toyota 3S-GTE Upgrades, Best and Worst Years for Tacoma Trucks, and our 1GZ-FE V12 guide. Honda vs Toyota Reliability, The History Honda and Toyota might be two of the biggest and most successful Japanese auto manufacturers today. However, they had some very different ways of getting there. Toyota got their start back in the late-19th century, when family patriarch Sakichi Toyoda started building hand looms. Later, in the 1930s, he switched to developing automobiles and engines. He soon conceived the Toyoda Motor Company, which later changed its name to Toyota. It was in the 1950s that Toyota first started selling automobiles on the U.S. market. In contrast, Honda‚Äôs history dates back to the 1930s, when founder Soichiro Honda began making piston rings for, of all people, the Toyoda Motor Company. However, somewhat ironically now, his quality was not up to par and Toyoda stopped working with him shortly after. By the 1940s, however, Honda had recovered. In 1948, he founded the Honda Motor Company, originally making bicycles with auxiliary engines. They soon began making motorcycles, and in the 1960s they ventured into the automobile market. Honda had already come stateside in 1959, making a big name for themselves on the American market. By the 1980s, both Honda and Toyota were among the most popular and consistent car brands among Americans. Not widely known for their performance or luxury in terms of production cars, they both made a name for themselves by producing inexpensive and fuel-efficient motors that would last forever and were cheap to operate. Behind the scenes, their racing pedigrees gave them ample time to test out new concepts, some of which would eventually make their way on major roadways. Today, Honda and Toyota always rank at the top of dependability and trustworthiness scales, and they are practically unmatched with their brand loyalty and allegiance. Honda vs Toyota: Reliability Both Honda vs Toyota market their vehicles as being very capable and durable, and it‚Äôs not just talk. Hondas and Toyotas have a reputation among mechanics pretty much everywhere for being built to last. That‚Äôs not to say that they have no problems and have never had any duds, but for the most part when you buy a Honda or a Toyota you can typically depend on at least a few things, including it to last 250,000+ miles with proper maintenance, cheap operating costs, good fuel efficiency, and an economic sticker price. But how exactly have Honda vs Toyota achieved such reputations? Toyota‚Äôs Secret to Reliability For Toyota, as part of Toyota‚Äôs history of reliability, they have a very important manufacturing and creation process they call the Toyota Production System or TPS. The TPS consists of 15 different pillars that all help them streamline and improve every part of the building process. These range from ‚ÄúAndon,‚Äù which means they can bring production to a stop to highlight potential problems. To ‚ÄúPoka-Yoke,‚Äù which refers to the failsafe devices they have that help mistake-proof the process. In addition to TPS, Toyota also has three major reasons for maintaining such a high level of proficiency and dependability: Their cars and engines are underpowered but overengineered, they promote practicality over performance, and they have an absolute wealth of experience in several different automotive and technological facets. As far as being underpowered but overengineered, it‚Äôs pretty common knowledge that Toyota builds their engines to be capable of way more performance than they give them. For example, most of their engines only make around 200-250 horsepower. However, most of these same engines can easily handle 300+ horsepower given their stout internals, they are just horribly detuned from the factory. Toyota does that so they will last forever without needing a rebuild, and it seems to work pretty well. In the same vein, they also clearly focus on practicality over performance. Most of their models are economy or mid-tier offerings, and they really save most high-end marketing for the luxury Lexus brand. When you buy a Toyota you know what you are getting, something functional, predictable, and pragmatic. Toyota has been building cars for nearly a century, and they definitely know what works and what doesn‚Äôt by now. They have dominated the worldwide car industry for decades and show no signs of slowing down. Honda‚Äôs Secret to Reliability Honda‚Äôs path to reliability was much different than Toyota‚Äôs, but it was not any less effective. While Honda does not have a fancy pillared TPS system like Toyota does, they do have their own process that actually incorporates some of the same concepts. These include ‚ÄúKaizen,‚Äù which means continuous improvement or good change. Kaizen refers to the process of Honda employees always giving feedback to help make sure the system functions as efficiently as possible. They also utilize JIT, or Just-in-Time, meaning everything is built on-time and per order, reducing waste and saving money. Additionally, Honda has a hybrid production line that has both robotic machinery and humans, which is also similar to Toyota. Humans are able to perform quality control and inspection checks to make sure the robotics are performing optimally. If a Honda employee notices something is going south, or likewise that there is room for improvement, they can stop the machine until a solution is discovered and implemented. This again helps to reduce unnecessary waste and save money. Honda also has a very extensive motorsports history, which they have used as a proving ground of sorts for many of their products. From building early rally cars to competing in Formula 1, Honda has long been a big name in auto racing. Some of the suspension and engine components they have used to win them racing championships have later found their way into passenger cars that now haul families to and from the grocery store. Which is More Reliable? So, Honda vs Toyota, which is truly the more reliable manufacturer? While it‚Äôs certainly close, most people would give the edge to Toyota. Toyota has been building cars a little bit longer, and they were the first Asian car manufacturer to truly make it big stateside. As a result, they still rank the highest today among consumers for the most reliable brand. Part of this is brand loyalty, as many buyers purchased a Toyota decades ago and have stayed with them for new cars, but it‚Äôs hard to argue with the results. In 2021, Toyota became the number one selling auto manufacturer for the U.S. market, making more than 2.3 million vehicles (according to CNBC). This was a monumental accomplishment, and really shows just how popular they are. Honda sold less than half the amount Toyota did in the U.S. Furthermore, just looking at Car and Driver‚Äôs list of the best selling cars for 2022, it‚Äôs easy to see why Toyota rates so high. They have two cars in the top five, three in the top 10, and five in the top 20. In contrast, Honda has one in the top 10 and only two in the top 25, total. It‚Äôs very close, but we have to give Toyota the edge on this one. Honda vs Toyota: Reliability, Summary Overall, Honda and Toyota are two of the most reliable brands in the world.

They have been building cars for longer, build a lot more every year, and in general seem to rate higher for most consumers. That‚Äôs not to say that Honda is bad, but they just can‚Äôt compete with Toyota‚Äôs reputation and standing.
